<h2> ──★ ˙ ̟  a lil' background! </h2>
before APC, i studied in Pasig City Science High School for 6 years. <br>
and right now, i am pursuing a bachelor's degree in information technology <br>
specializing in mobile and internet technology!
i am a scholar of SM Foundation, which means i have a 100% discount on my tuition fee.
<h2> ──★ ˙ ̟  why information technology? </h2>
i chose this course because since we're in the modern age, i was advised by my uncle <br>
to choose a course that will open a lot of opportunities career-wise. <br>
moreover, i also took computer-related electives during junior high school, <br>
such as web design, programming, and game development. <br>
<h2> ──★ ˙ ̟  hobbies & interests !! </h2>
my hobbies include reading, playing games, and listening to music. <br>
i also recently just tried crocheting, which is quite fun. <br>
here are some of my crochet projects that i'm proud of so far: <br>
